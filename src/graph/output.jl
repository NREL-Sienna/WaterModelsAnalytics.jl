Write out to a file a visualization for a WaterModels network dictionary parsed from an
EPANET file. `basefilename` should not include an extension and will be appended with
`_w_cb.pdf` in the final output file, which is a multi-page PDF. The `layout` option equates
to the layout functions of graphviz (dot, neato, etc.). Use `del_files=false` to keep the
intermediate files. If a `solution` dict is provided, it should be for the same time as that
of the `data` dict.
